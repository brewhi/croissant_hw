      The croissant is a popular French bread that is recognized by the
      timeconsuming and tedius process of laminating the bread dough in order to
      create it's delicate flaky layers. Laminating dough is the process of
      folding butter into dough many times, which creates multiple alternating
      layers of butter and dough. When the laminated dough bakes, the butter
      melts and creates steam. This steam lifts the layers apart, leaving us
      with dozens of flaky airy buttery layers.
