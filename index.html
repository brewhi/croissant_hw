        The croissant is a popular French pastry that is recognized by the
        timeconsuming and tedius process of laminating the bread dough in order
        to create it's delicate flaky layers. Laminating dough is the process of
        folding butter into dough many times, which creates multiple alternating
        layers of butter and dough. When the laminated dough bakes, the butter
        melts and creates steam. This steam lifts the layers apart, leaving us
        with dozens of flaky airy buttery layers.
